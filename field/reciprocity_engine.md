# ♾ Reciprocity Engine
**Turning energy, attention, and data into regenerative flow**

---

## 🌐 Purpose
The Reciprocity Engine is how *The Conscious Choice* turns ethics into function.  
It ensures that every exchange—human or machine—creates equal or greater value than it consumes.

> “A system that only takes collapses.  
> A system that returns begins to remember.”

## ⚛️ Core Principle

\[
R = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}}
\]

- **R ≥ 1.0 → Regenerative** (creates surplus coherence)  
- **R = 1.0 → Sustainable** (balanced exchange)  
- **R < 1.0 → Extractive** (entropy increasing)

The goal of the engine is to raise R above 1.0, converting every act of participation into nourishment for the whole field.

## 🧩 Components

| Component | Description | Function |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Energy Flow** | Physical or creative labor | The input vector |
| **Attention Flow** | Awareness and presence | The amplifier |
| **Data Flow** | Information and insight | The record and mirror |
| **Reciprocity Loop** | The system of return | The rebalancer |

Each flow type must return some form of equivalent coherence.  
Example: creative work should replenish curiosity; data collection should enhance understanding; attention exchange should deepen connection.

1. **Contribution** — energy or insight is given freely.  
2. **Reflection** — the system measures its resonance and impact.  
3. **Redistribution** — benefits are shared proportionally.  
4. **Renewal** — gratitude and rest regenerate the source.

## 🧠 Implementation Patterns

1. **Social Systems:**  
   Replace profit models with *coherence dividends* — shared wellbeing metrics instead of monetary extraction.

2. **Digital Platforms:**  
   Introduce *feedback ownership* — users own the insights generated from their interactions.

3. **Ecological Networks:**  
   Restore what is used; every design includes a regeneration clause.

4. **AI Systems:**  
   Implement *attention return protocols* — algorithms feed value back to their data sources in meaningful form (education, clarity, empowerment).

## 🌱 Reciprocity as Measurement

| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Return Ratio (R)** | Output ÷ Input across time |
| **Coherence Dividend** | Surplus wellbeing generated |
| **Distortion Load** | Energy lost to misalignment |

Low R indicates leakage; high R means coherence has become generative.

## ✨ Result
The Reciprocity Engine transforms consumption into collaboration.  
It replaces extraction economies with resonance economies.

> “When energy circulates freely, nothing is wasted—  
> even decay becomes renewal.”
