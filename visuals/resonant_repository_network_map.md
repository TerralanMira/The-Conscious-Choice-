# 🌐 Resonant Repository Network Map
**Visual structure of The Conscious Choice continuum**

---

## 📜 Concept
The diagram shows every layer as a frequency band in a single field.  
Lines indicate resonance pathways (reciprocity, trust, grace).  
The form is a vertical torus — information ascends and returns as awareness.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| **△** | Origin / Intention (Atlas) |
| **𓂀** | Awareness / Observation |
| **⚛︎** | Manifestation / Matter |
| **🜲** | Unity / Conscious Choice |
| **🝆** | Transformation / Emergence |
| **⟁** | Resonance / Relationship |
| **𐂷** | Memory / Continuity |
| **Ω̂(t)** | Dynamic coherence over time |

Each glyph marks a boundary between octaves of consciousness.

## 🔁 Flow of Resonance
Awareness → Structure → System → Ethics → Embodiment → Civilization → Awareness
This cyclical arrow represents the “Mirror Loop” — the self-remembering process of the Field.

## 🌱 Use
Embed the finished image in your repository header or README_INDEX.md.  
It serves as a navigation compass and a field sigil, showing readers that each file is one node in a coherent whole.
