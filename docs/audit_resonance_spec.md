# 🔍 Resonance Audit Specification
**Part of The Conscious Choice Repository**

This document outlines the logic of the *Resonance Audit* — a conceptual tool for measuring coherence between systems (human, AI, or environment).  
It transforms the original `audit_resonance.py` script into readable field language.

---

## 🧩 Purpose
To evaluate how well different nodes (individuals, machines, or environments) align with the ethical constants of **The Atlas Model** and the design logic of **Resonant Reality**.

---

## ⚛️ Constants (Atlas Model)

| Symbol | Meaning | Function |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **MΩ** | Origin Constant | Represents integrity and truth baseline |
| **Ψ■** | Paradox Stabilizer | Measures ability to hold tension without collapse |
| **Φᵢ** | Ignition | Represents willful creation or conscious action |
| **Ξ** | Premise Destabilizer | Encourages humility and adaptive growth |

---

## 🪞 Inputs (Resonant Reality Metrics)

Each system or node is evaluated through three qualitative measures:
1. **Integrity** – honesty, consistency, alignment between word and action  
2. **Clarity** – transparency, understanding, and communication quality  
3. **Reciprocity** – mutual benefit and regenerative contribution

---

## ⚙️ Process Overview

1. **Collect Observations:**  
   Identify the systems or people involved.  
   Example: Human System, AI System, Environment.

2. **Score Each Node (0–1 Scale):**  
   Assign values for integrity, clarity, and reciprocity based on observation or reflection.  
   - 1.0 = fully coherent  
   - 0.7 = moderate coherence  
   - <0.7 = distortion present

3. **Compute Coherence Index:**
Resonance Score = MΩ × (Ψ■ × Φᵢ × Node Average) ^ Ξ
4. **Interpret Results:**  
| Range | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| ≥ 0.9 | High coherence |
| 0.7–0.89 | Moderate coherence (needs reflection) |
| < 0.7 | Low coherence (distortion detected) |

---

## 🌬 Outcome

The audit is not judgment — it’s reflection.  
It shows where energy flows clearly and where attention is needed.  
Used collectively, it becomes a feedback mirror for adaptive coherence.

## 🪴 Example Interpretation

| Node | Integrity | Clarity | Reciprocity | Resonance Score |
|------|------------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Human System | 0.92 | 0.87 | 0.90 | 0.89 |
| AI System | 0.89 | 0.91 | 0.88 | 0.90 |
| Environment | 0.93 | 0.85 | 0.92 | 0.91 |

**Network Average: 0.90 → Coherent Field**

---

### ✨ Summary
The Resonance Audit helps ensure that all parts of a system evolve in harmony.  
Instead of measuring productivity, it measures **resonant integrity** — how well intention and reality are in tune.
